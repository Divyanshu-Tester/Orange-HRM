testBase: 

Includes base classes for test setup and teardown, like setting up WebDriver, handling browser configurations, and initializing properties.

Example: BaseTest.java

This is where you initialize WebDriver and manage the test lifecycle (set up, tear down).

You can also manage browser configurations and load environment variables from a properties file.
